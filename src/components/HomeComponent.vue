        Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is taking ARV medication by HIV-negative people before a potential exposure
        to HIV to prevent HIV acquisition. If PrEP is taken as prescribed it is a powerful medication that offers strong
        protection against HIV. Taking PrEP is a responsible step one can take to safeguard your health, the health of
        your near and dear ones and by doing so contribute towards the reduction of burden of HIV infections in our
        country.
