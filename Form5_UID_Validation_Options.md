# Form5 UID Validation Options

## Current Approach (2-Step Validation)

### Step 1: CSV Validation
- Checks if UID exists in participant CSV list
- **Purpose**: Ensure only registered participants can use the form

### Step 2: Form Data Check  
- Checks Google Apps Script for existing unscheduled visit data
- **Purpose**: Determine if showing "Add New" or "Update" mode

## Alternative Approach (Form Data Only)

### Single Step: Direct Form Data Check
- Skip CSV validation entirely
- Only check Google Apps Script for existing data
- Allow any UID format to proceed

## Pros and Cons

### Current Approach (CSV + Form Data)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Ensures only registered participants can submit
- ✅ Data integrity maintained
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized entries

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex validation process
- ❌ Requires maintaining CSV data
- ❌ Two potential points of failure

### Alternative Approach (Form Data Only)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Simpler validation process
- ✅ Works even if CSV is unavailable
- ✅ Faster user experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Anyone can submit with any UID
- ❌ No participant registration validation
- ❌ Potential data quality issues

## Recommendation

**Keep current approach** if:
- You need to ensure only registered participants can submit
- Data integrity is critical
- You maintain an active participant registry

**Switch to form data only** if:
- You trust users to enter correct UIDs
- Speed and simplicity are more important
- CSV maintenance is problematic
